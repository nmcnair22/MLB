Extract the following information from the telecom bill document:

1. Master account details:
   - Account number (typically a numeric identifier at the top of the bill)
   - Invoice date
   - Total due

2. For each sub-account (location):
   - Sub-account number (look for a numeric identifier, often labeled as "Account Number" or similar, NOT the address line)
   - Location address
   - Line items, each with:
      - Description
      - Date range
      - Prorated charges
      - Recurring charges
      - One time charges
      - Adjustments and surcharges
      - Taxes, fees
      - Total
   - Total due for the sub-account (only if explicitly stated in the document as a total amount for that location)

Important guidelines for extraction:
- Sub-account numbers are typically numeric or alphanumeric identifiers, not descriptive text
- Do not use address lines or location names as sub-account numbers
- Look for patterns like "Account #", "Account Number", or similar labels near the sub-account number
- If a sub-account number contains a hyphen followed by a name (e.g., "102740-SCHWAN'S"), that is acceptable
- If you cannot find a clear sub-account number, use "Unknown" rather than guessing

Format the output as JSON with the structure provided below. If the total due for a sub-account is not explicitly stated, leave the "total_due" field blank. Do not calculate it from the line items.
