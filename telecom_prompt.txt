Extract the following information from the telecom bill document:

1. Master account details:
   - Account number
   - Invoice date
   - Total due

2. For each sub-account (location):
   - Sub-account number
   - Location address
   - Line items, each with:
      - Description
      - Date range
      - Prorated charges
      - Recurring charges
      - One time charges
      - Adjustments and surcharges
      - Taxes, fees
      - Total
   - Total due for the sub-account (only if explicitly stated in the document as a total amount for that location)

Format the output as JSON with the structure provided below. If the total due for a sub-account is not explicitly stated, leave the "total_due" field blank. Do not calculate it from the line items.
